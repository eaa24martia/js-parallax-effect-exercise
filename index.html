            <h2>Wicked</h2>
            <h4>A Story of Magic and Betrayal</h4>
            <p>Before Dorothy ever arrived in Oz, there was another story—one of friendship, rebellion, and the truth behind the so-called Wicked Witch of the West. *Wicked*, the highly anticipated film adaptation of the hit Broadway musical, brings to life the untold tale of Elphaba and Glinda, two young women whose paths cross in the most magical yet heartbreaking of ways.</p>
    
            <h4>The Origins of Wickedness</h4>
            <p>Elphaba, born with emerald-green skin, has always been seen as an outcast. Feared and misunderstood, she struggles to find her place in a world that refuses to accept her. Meanwhile, Glinda, the golden-haired embodiment of charm and perfection, quickly rises in popularity. But as their friendship deepens, so does the divide between them, leading Elphaba down a path where she is labeled as “wicked.”</p>
    
            <h4>Spellbinding Performances</h4>
            <p>With a stellar cast led by Cynthia Erivo as Elphaba and Ariana Grande as Glinda, *Wicked* promises to deliver not just stunning visuals, but also powerhouse performances of beloved songs like *Defying Gravity* and *Popular*. Their dynamic chemistry will breathe new life into a story that has captivated audiences for decades.</p>
    
            <h4>The Magic of Oz Reimagined</h4>
            <p>From the dazzling halls of Shiz University to the emerald streets of the fabled city, *Wicked* will transport viewers into a world both familiar and new. Fans of *The Wizard of Oz* will see a different perspective on the events they thought they knew, unveiling the true nature of good, evil, and everything in between.</p>
    
            <h4>A Tale of Friendship, Power, and Destiny</h4>
            <p>*Wicked* is more than a fairy tale; it is a story of self-discovery, defiance, and the cost of being different. It asks the question: is wickedness truly born, or is it created by those who refuse to understand? With its breathtaking music, emotional depth, and spectacular visuals, this adaptation is set to enchant both longtime fans and newcomers alike.</p>
